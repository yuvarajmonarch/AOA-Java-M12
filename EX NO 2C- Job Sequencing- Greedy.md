# EX 2C Job Sequencing using Greedy Approach
## DATE:10-11-2025
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j such that |nums[i] - nums[j]| == k.

The value of |x| is defined as:

x if x >= 0.
-x if x < 0.You're given N jobs, each with:

A unique jobId

A deadline (by which it must be completed)

A profit (earned only if completed on or before the deadline)

Each job:

Takes exactly 1 unit of time

Only one job can be done at a time

Your goal is to maximize total profit while completing the maximum number of jobs possible within their deadlines.

## Algorithm
1. Start  
2. Read the integer `n` (number of jobs).  
3. For each job, input three values — `id`, `deadline`, and `profit` — and store them in an array of `Job` objects.  
4. Sort the jobs in **descending order of profit** using a custom comparator.  
5. Find the maximum deadline among all jobs to determine the total number of available time slots.  
6. Create a boolean array `slot[]` of size `maxDeadline + 1` to track which time slots are filled.  
7. Initialize `totalProfit = 0` and `countJobs = 0`.  
8. For each job in the sorted list:  
   - Check from its deadline down to 1 to find a free slot.  
   - If a free slot is found, mark it as occupied (`slot[j] = true`).  
   - Add the job’s profit to `totalProfit` and increment `countJobs`.  
9. After scheduling all possible jobs, return the total number of jobs done (`countJobs`) and the total profit (`totalProfit`).  
10. Print both values.  
11. End
